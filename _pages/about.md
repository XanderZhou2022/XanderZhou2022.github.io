## About Me

I am **Yixi (Xander) Zhou**, an undergraduate researcher and computer science student with a passion for machine learning, data mining, and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at both the University of Wisconsin-Madison and ShanghaiTech University, where I engage in cutting-edge research and maintain excellent academic performance.

## Research & Experience

As an undergraduate researcher at ShanghaiTech University's Financial Intelligence Laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Haipeng ZHANG, I focus on developing innovative solutions using large language models and graph neural networks. My current research involves fine-grained classification of life trajectories from Wikipedia data, achieving significant improvements in multi-classification accuracy through syntactic graph fusion techniques.

I have led several AI and machine learning projects, including named entity recognition in financial technology using Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields, analysis of quadratic programming solvers, and media engagement prediction systems. These projects have helped me develop expertise in Python, machine learning frameworks, and data analysis techniques.

## Interests & Goals

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and financial technology. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that can handle complex, real-world data challenges and contribute to the advancement of AI applications in various domains.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, and I look forward to continuing my academic journey while contributing to meaningful technological innovations.
