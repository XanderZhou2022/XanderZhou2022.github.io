## About Me

I am **Yixi (Xander) Zhou**, an incoming Ph.D. student in computer science at [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/) (Sept 2026–2030, expected), advised by [Renchi Yang](https://renchi.ac.cn/). I am also a member of the [LAGAS Group](https://renchi.ac.cn/team/) (HKBU Database Lab). I am completing my B.S. at ShanghaiTech University. I spent Jan–Aug 2025 on exchange at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since Nov 2025 I have been a remote research assistant at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), working on **financial AI** under [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) and [Zhuohan Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W9mk-R4AAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a research assistant with [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) and Nikkei on **financial LLM**, supervised by [Fan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s78gW7kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yu Chen](https://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/gsfs/faculty/chen_yu/). During my undergraduate studies I have also been a researcher at ShanghaiTech's [Financial Intelligence Laboratory](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/zhanghp/), advised by [Haipeng Zhang](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/zhanghp/).

## Research & Interests

**Ph.D. research direction:** data agent.

My work spans **life trajectory classification** (LLMs and graph fusion on Wikipedia-style data), **financial AI and NLP**, **optimization**, and **predictive analytics**. My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, and financial technology—LLMs, graph fusion, fairness in credit scoring, and interpretable retrieval. I am particularly interested in algorithms and systems that handle complex, real-world data and contribute to AI applications in data management and analytics.

If you are interested in specific projects, see the [CV](/cv/) (Experience and Projects sections). I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical applications, and I look forward to continuing my academic journey while contributing to meaningful technological innovations.
