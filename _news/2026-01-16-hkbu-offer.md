**Excited to share:** I received an offer to pursue my Ph.D. in computer science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)! I traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong, visited the HKBU campus, and had a great discussion with my future Ph.D. advisor about research directions. Very happy and looking forward to joining in Fall 2026.
